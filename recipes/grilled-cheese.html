        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I made this grilled cheese recipe after years of trying variations the the basic grilled cheese design. I used butter instead of mayo to give the flavor a better punch. I also used slightly more than usual, letting more butter soak into the bread as it's being cooked.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2</strong>pieces of<strong>butter bread</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2</strong>pieces of<strong>cheddar cheese</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1.5 tbsp</strong>of<strong>butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat stove and pan to a 6/10 heat (or low-level medium-high heat on gas stoves).</li>
            <li>Melt butter on pan as you prepare other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once your butter has melted, put your first pice of bread down on the pan and spread the cheese on top of it evenly.</li>
            <li>Put the last piece of bread on the grilled cheese and stir in around a little with the spatula. This helps cover the sides of the bread with butter, while preserving some for when you flip it over.</li>
            <li>Let this cook until the butter turns golden-brown and the cheese has started melting. Then, flip over the grilled cheese and stir it around until almost all of the butter has coated the bread.</li>
            <li>Continue stirring, while flipping frequently until both sides are golden-brown, Then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Move the grilled cheese to a plate and sprinkle 3 light coats of salt on the top.</li>
            <li>Cut the grilled cheese diagonally and serve</li>
        </ol>
